**StrawDI: The Strawberry Digital Images Data Set** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the agricultural industry. 

The dataset consists of 3100 images with 17938 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*strawberry*).

Images in the StrawDI dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (200 images), *train* (2800 images), and *val* (100 images)The dataset was released in 2020 by the University of Huelva, Spain.

Here is the visualized example grid with animated annotations:
